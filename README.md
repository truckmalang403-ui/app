# 1VPN App
The 1VPN app changes your IP address by routing your devices  internet traffic through one of our secure servers. 1VPN can be used to bypass internet censorship, access region-restricted content, prevent ISPs and network administrators from knowing which websites you visit, and protect against IP address-based tracking.

## Local Build 

[docs/onevpn/building.md](docs/onevpn/building.md) has the full steps. In short:

1. Install [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) and run `mise install`. `mise.toml` pins Flutter. The
   build also needs the Android SDK and JDK 17.
2. Stage the two native inputs. Neither is committed. `tool/pins.env` pins both.
   - `android/app/libs/libXray.aar`: release builds use the aar that
     `.github/workflows/libxray.yml` publishes, built from the pinned
     [libXray](https://github.com/XTLS/libXray) and Xray-core commits. `tool/build.sh` checks
     that aar against its SHA-256 pin. [building.md](docs/onevpn/building.md#2-the-libxray-aar)
     names the published aar and covers a source build with `--unpinned-core`.
   - `assets/dat/geoip.dat` and `assets/dat/geosite.dat`: the `geoip.dat` asset of the
     [v2fly/geoip](https://github.com/v2fly/geoip) release `GEOIP_RELEASE`, and the `dlc.dat`
     asset of the [v2fly/domain-list-community](https://github.com/v2fly/domain-list-community)
     release `GEOSITE_RELEASE`, saved as `geosite.dat`.
   - Check the two geodata files against their SHA-256 pins.
3. Optionally, copy `env/local.example.json` to `env/local.json` and fill in the defines.
4. Run `mise exec -- tool/build.sh --apk`. With an aar built from source, run
   `mise exec -- tool/build.sh --apk --unpinned-core`. The debug APK lands in
   `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-debug.apk`.

### Build-time defines

`env/local.example.json` names the defines. `tool/build.sh` passes `env/local.json` to Flutter
when the file exists. `env/local.json` is gitignored.

| Define | Holds |
|---|---|
| `ONEVPN_UUID`, `ONEVPN_PBK`, `ONEVPN_SID` | The connection credentials for the free locations |
| `ONEVPN_FREE_NODE_IPS` | The IP literal for each free location |
| `ONEVPN_RC_SDK_KEY` | The store SDK key for in-app purchases |
| `ONEVPN_FAKE_PURCHASES` | `true` runs the paywall against a local fake store |
| `ONEVPN_ADMOB_APP_ID_ANDROID`, `ONEVPN_ADMOB_INTERSTITIAL_ANDROID` | The AdMob app and interstitial ids. Empty, the build takes Google's test ids |

An empty define builds and runs. With the three connection defines empty, the free catalogue is
empty. With no store key, the paywall shows placeholder pricing.

### Release bundle

`tool/build.sh --aab` builds the release bundle. It takes the defines from the environment, not
from `env/local.json`. It needs your own store key and connection credentials, and it refuses an
empty or test store key. The bundle is unsigned. Signing it needs your own upload key.

## Layout

| Path | Holds |
|---|---|
| `lib/` | The Dart app. `lib/onevpn/` and `lib/main_1vpn.dart` are the fork's code |
| `test/` | The test suite. `test/onevpn/` covers the fork's code |
| `android/` | The Android platform tree and the VPN service |
| `ios/`, `swift/` | The iOS app and its tunnel |
| `assets/` | Icons, region data and the staged geodata |
| `pigeon/`, `c/` | Platform channel and native interface definitions |
| `tool/` | The build script, the pins and the code generators |
| `env/` | The define template |
| `docs/onevpn/` | The fork's developer docs |
| `fastlane/` | The Play listing text, screenshots and release notes |
| `.github/` | The CI workflows |
